Parameters
----------
criterion : {"squared_error", "friedman_mse", "absolute_error",             "poisson"}, default="squared_error"
    The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
    are "squared_error" for the mean squared error, which is equal to
    variance reduction as feature selection criterion and minimizes the L2
    loss using the mean of each terminal node, "friedman_mse", which uses
    mean squared error with Friedman's improvement score for potential
    splits, "absolute_error" for the mean absolute error, which minimizes
    the L1 loss using the median of each terminal node, and "poisson" which
    uses reduction in Poisson deviance to find splits.

    .. versionadded:: 0.18
       Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion.

    .. versionadded:: 0.24
        Poisson deviance criterion.

splitter : {"best", "random"}, default="best"
    The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported
    strategies are "best" to choose the best split and "random" to choose
    the best random split.

max_depth : int, default=None
    The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
    all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
    min_samples_split samples.

min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
    The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

    - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
    - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
      `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
      number of samples for each split.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.18
       Added float values for fractions.

min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
    The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
    A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
    least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
    right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
    especially in regression.

    - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
    - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
      `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
      number of samples for each node.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.18
       Added float values for fractions.

min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
    The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
    the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
    equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

max_features : int, float or {"sqrt", "log2"}, default=None
    The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

    - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
    - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
      `max(1, int(max_features * n_features_in_))` features are considered at each
      split.
    - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
    - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
    - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

    Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
    valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
    effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
    Controls the randomness of the estimator. The features are always
    randomly permuted at each split, even if ``splitter`` is set to
    ``"best"``. When ``max_features < n_features``, the algorithm will
    select ``max_features`` at random at each split before finding the best
    split among them. But the best found split may vary across different
    runs, even if ``max_features=n_features``. That is the case, if the
    improvement of the criterion is identical for several splits and one
    split has to be selected at random. To obtain a deterministic behaviour
    during fitting, ``random_state`` has to be fixed to an integer.
    See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.

max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
    Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
    Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
    If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
    A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
    greater than or equal to this value.

    The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

        N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                            - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

    where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
    samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
    left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

    ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
    if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

    .. versionadded:: 0.19

ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
    Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
    subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
    ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See
    :ref:`minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details.

    .. versionadded:: 0.22

monotonic_cst : array-like of int of shape (n_features), default=None
    Indicates the monotonicity constraint to enforce on each feature.
      - 1: monotonic increase
      - 0: no constraint
      - -1: monotonic decrease

    If monotonic_cst is None, no constraints are applied.

    Monotonicity constraints are not supported for:
      - multioutput regressions (i.e. when `n_outputs_ > 1`),
      - regressions trained on data with missing values.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <monotonic_cst_gbdt>`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.4

Attributes
----------
feature_importances_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
    The feature importances.
    The higher, the more important the feature.
    The importance of a feature is computed as the
    (normalized) total reduction of the criterion brought
    by that feature. It is also known as the Gini importance [4]_.

    Warning: impurity-based feature importances can be misleading for
    high cardinality features (many unique values). See
    :func:`sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance` as an alternative.

max_features_ : int
    The inferred value of max_features.

n_features_in_ : int
    Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

    .. versionadded:: 0.24

feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
    Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
    has feature names that are all strings.

    .. versionadded:: 1.0

n_outputs_ : int
    The number of outputs when ``fit`` is performed.

tree_ : Tree instance
    The underlying Tree object. Please refer to
    ``help(sklearn.tree._tree.Tree)`` for attributes of Tree object and
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_tree_plot_unveil_tree_structure.py`
    for basic usage of these attributes.

Notes
-----
The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees
(e.g. ``max_depth``, ``min_samples_leaf``, etc.) lead to fully grown and
unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To
reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be
controlled by setting those parameter values.

Extra-trees differ from classic decision trees in the way they are built.
When looking for the best split to separate the samples of a node into two
groups, random splits are drawn for each of the `max_features` randomly
selected features and the best split among those is chosen. When
`max_features` is set 1, this amounts to building a totally random
decision tree.

Warning: Extra-trees should only be used within ensemble methods.

          `max(1, int(max_features * n_features_in_))` features are considered at
          each split.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

    Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
    valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
    effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
    Controls the randomness of the estimator. The features are always
    randomly permuted at each split, even if ``splitter`` is set to
    ``"best"``. When ``max_features < n_features``, the algorithm will
    select ``max_features`` at random at each split before finding the best
    split among them. But the best found split may vary across different
    runs, even if ``max_features=n_features``. That is the case, if the
    improvement of the criterion is identical for several splits and one
    split has to be selected at random. To obtain a deterministic behaviour
    during fitting, ``random_state`` has to be fixed to an integer.
    See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.

max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
    Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
    Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
    If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
    A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
    greater than or equal to this value.

    The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

        N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                            - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

    where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
    samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
    left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

    ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
    if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

    .. versionadded:: 0.19

class_weight : dict, list of dict or "balanced", default=None
    Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.
    If None, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For
    multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same
    order as the columns of y.

    Note that for multioutput (including multilabel) weights should be
    defined for each class of every column in its own dict. For example,
    for four-class multilabel classification weights should be
    [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] instead of
    [{1:1}, {2:5}, {3:1}, {4:1}].

    The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
    weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
    as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``

    For multi-output, the weights of each column of y will be multiplied.

    Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed
    through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.

ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
    Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
    subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
    ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See
    :ref:`minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details.

    .. versionadded:: 0.22

monotonic_cst : array-like of int of shape (n_features), default=None
    Indicates the monotonicity constraint to enforce on each feature.
      - 1: monotonic increase
      - 0: no constraint
      - -1: monotonic decrease

    If monotonic_cst is None, no constraints are applied.

    Monotonicity constraints are not supported for:
      - multiclass classifications (i.e. when `n_classes > 2`),
      - multioutput classifications (i.e. when `n_outputs_ > 1`),
      - classifications trained on data with missing values.

    The constraints hold over the probability of the positive class.

Attributes
----------
classes_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,) or list of ndarray
    The classes labels (single output problem),
    or a list of arrays of class labels (multi-output problem).

feature_importances_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
    The impurity-based feature importances.
    The higher, the more important the feature.
    The importance of a feature is computed as the (normalized)
    total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature.  It is also
    known as the Gini importance [4]_.

    Warning: impurity-based feature importances can be misleading for
    high cardinality features (many unique values). See
    :func:`sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance` as an alternative.

max_features_ : int
    The inferred value of max_features.

n_classes_ : int or list of int
    The number of classes (for single output problems),
    or a list containing the number of classes for each
    output (for multi-output problems).

n_features_in_ : int
    Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

    .. versionadded:: 0.24

feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
    Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
    has feature names that are all strings.

    .. versionadded:: 1.0

n_outputs_ : int
    The number of outputs when ``fit`` is performed.

tree_ : Tree instance
    The underlying Tree object. Please refer to
    ``help(sklearn.tree._tree.Tree)`` for attributes of Tree object and
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_tree_plot_unveil_tree_structure.py`
    for basic usage of these attributes.

Notes
-----
The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees
(e.g. ``max_depth``, ``min_samples_leaf``, etc.) lead to fully grown and
unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To
reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be
controlled by setting those parameter values.

The :meth:`predict` method operates using the :func:`numpy.argmax`
function on the outputs of :meth:`predict_proba`. This means that in
case the highest predicted probabilities are tied, the classifier will
predict the tied class with the lowest index in :term:`classes_`.

Extra-trees differ from classic decision trees in the way they are built.
When looking for the best split to separate the samples of a node into two
groups, random splits are drawn for each of the `max_features` randomly
selected features and the best split among those is chosen. When
`max_features` is set 1, this amounts to building a totally random
decision tree.

Warning: Extra-trees should only be used within ensemble methods.

Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <tree>`.

Parameters
----------
criterion : {"gini", "entropy", "log_loss"}, default="gini"
    The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are
    "gini" for the Gini impurity and "log_loss" and "entropy" both for the
    Shannon information gain, see :ref:`tree_mathematical_formulation`.

splitter : {"random", "best"}, default="random"
    The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported
    strategies are "best" to choose the best split and "random" to choose
    the best random split.

max_depth : int, default=None
    The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
    all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
    min_samples_split samples.

min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
    The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

    - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
    - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
      `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
      number of samples for each split.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.18
       Added float values for fractions.

min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
    The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
    A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
    least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
    right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
    especially in regression.

    - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
    - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
      `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
      number of samples for each node.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.18
       Added float values for fractions.

min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
    The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
    the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
    equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

max_features : int, float, {"sqrt", "log2"} or None, default="sqrt"
    The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

    - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
    - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
      `max(1, int(max_features * n_features_in_))` features are considered at
      each split.
    - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
    - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
    - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.1
        The default of `max_features` changed from `"auto"` to `"sqrt"`.

    Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
    valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
    effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
    Used to pick randomly the `max_features` used at each split.
    See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.

max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
    Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
    Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
    If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
    A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
    greater than or equal to this value.

    The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

        N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                            - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

    where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
    samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
    left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

    ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
    if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

    .. versionadded:: 0.19

class_weight : dict, list of dict or "balanced", default=None
    Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.
    If None, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For
    multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same
    order as the columns of y.

    Note that for multioutput (including multilabel) weights should be
    defined for each class of every column in its own dict. For example,
    for four-class multilabel classification weights should be
    [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] instead of

    The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust

ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
    Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
    subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
    ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See
