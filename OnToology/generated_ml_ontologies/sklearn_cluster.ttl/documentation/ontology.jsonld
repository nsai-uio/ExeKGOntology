This works for Scipy's metrics, but is less\n    efficient than passing the metric name as a string. If metric is\n    \"precomputed\", `X` is assumed to be a distance matrix and must be\n    square.\n\n    Valid values for metric are:\n\n    - from scikit-learn: ['cityblock', 'cosine', 'euclidean', 'l1', 'l2',\n      'manhattan']\n\n    - from scipy.spatial.distance: ['braycurtis', 'canberra', 'chebyshev',\n      'correlation', 'dice', 'hamming', 'jaccard', 'kulsinski',\n      'mahalanobis', 'minkowski', 'rogerstanimoto', 'russellrao',\n      'seuclidean', 'sokalmichener', 'sokalsneath', 'sqeuclidean',\n      'yule']\n\n    Sparse matrices are only supported by scikit-learn metrics.\n    See the documentation for scipy.spatial.distance for details on these\n    metrics.\n\n    .. note::\n       `'kulsinski'` is deprecated from SciPy 1.9 and will removed in SciPy 1.11.\n\np : float, default=2\n    Parameter for the Minkowski metric from\n    :class:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances`. When p = 1, this is\n    equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance\n    (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.\n\nmetric_params : dict, default=None\n    Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.\n\ncluster_method : str, default='xi'\n    The extraction method used to extract clusters using the calculated\n    reachability and ordering. Possible values are \"xi\" and \"dbscan\".\n\neps : float, default=None\n    The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as\n    in the neighborhood of the other. By default it assumes the same value\n    as ``max_eps``.\n    Used only when ``cluster_method='dbscan'``.\n\nxi : float between 0 and 1, default=0.05\n    Determines the minimum steepness on the reachability plot that\n    constitutes a cluster boundary. For example, an upwards point in the\n    reachability plot is defined by the ratio from one point to its\n    successor being at most 1-xi.\n    Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\npredecessor_correction : bool, default=True\n    Correct clusters according to the predecessors calculated by OPTICS\n    [2]_. This parameter has minimal effect on most datasets.\n    Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\nmin_cluster_size : int > 1 or float between 0 and 1, default=None\n    Minimum number of samples in an OPTICS cluster, expressed as an\n    absolute number or a fraction of the number of samples (rounded to be\n    at least 2). If ``None``, the value of ``min_samples`` is used instead.\n    Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\nalgorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, default='auto'\n    Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:\n\n    - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.BallTree`.\n    - 'kd_tree' will use :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.KDTree`.\n    - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.\n    - 'auto' (default) will attempt to decide the most appropriate\n      algorithm based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method.\n\n    Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of\n    this parameter, using brute force.\n\nleaf_size : int, default=30\n    Leaf size passed to :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.BallTree` or\n    :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.KDTree`. This can affect the speed of the\n    construction and query, as well as the memory required to store the\n    tree. The optimal value depends on the nature of the problem.\n\nmemory : str or object with the joblib.Memory interface, default=None\n    Used to cache the output of the computation of the tree.\n    By default, no caching is done.

The clusters are ordered according to\n    ``(end, -start)`` (ascending) so that larger clusters encompassing\n    smaller clusters come after those smaller ones. Since ``labels_`` does\n    not reflect the hierarchy, usually\n    ``len(cluster_hierarchy_) > np.unique(optics.labels_)``. Please also\n    note that these indices are of the ``ordering_``, i.e.\n    ``X[ordering_][start:end + 1]`` form a cluster.\n    Only available when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\nn_features_in_ : int\n    Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.\n\n    .. versionadded:: 0.24\n\nfeature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)\n    Names of features seen during :term:`fit`.

May be\n    'randomized' or 'arpack'. If 'randomized', use\n    :func:`sklearn.utils.extmath.randomized_svd`, which may be faster\n    for large matrices. If 'arpack', use\n    :func:`scipy.sparse.linalg.svds`, which is more accurate, but\n    possibly slower in some cases.\n\nn_svd_vecs : int, default=None\n    Number of vectors to use in calculating the SVD. Corresponds\n    to `ncv` when `svd_method=arpack` and `n_oversamples` when\n    `svd_method` is 'randomized`.\n\nmini_batch : bool, default=False\n    Whether to use mini-batch k-means, which is faster but may get\n    different results.\n\ninit : {'k-means++', 'random'}, or ndarray of shape             (n_clusters, n_features), default='k-means++'\n    Method for initialization of k-means algorithm; defaults to\n    'k-means++'.\n\nn_init : int, default=10\n    Number of random initializations that are tried with the\n    k-means algorithm.\n\n    If mini-batch k-means is used, the best initialization is\n    chosen and the algorithm runs once. Otherwise, the algorithm\n    is run for each initialization and the best solution chosen.\n\nrandom_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None\n    Used for randomizing the singular value decomposition and the k-means\n    initialization. Use an int to make the randomness deterministic.\n    See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.\n\nAttributes\n----------\nrows_ : array-like of shape (n_row_clusters, n_rows)\n    Results of the clustering. `rows[i, r]` is True if\n    cluster `i` contains row `r`. Available only after calling ``fit``.\n\ncolumns_ : array-like of shape (n_column_clusters, n_columns)\n    Results of the clustering, like `rows`.\n\nrow_labels_ : array-like of shape (n_rows,)\n    The bicluster label of each row.\n\ncolumn_labels_ : array-like of shape (n_cols,)\n    The bicluster label of each column.\n\nbiclusters_ : tuple of two ndarrays\n    The tuple contains the `rows_` and `columns_` arrays.\n\nn_features_in_ : int\n    Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.\n\n    .. versionadded:: 0.24\n\nfeature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)\n    Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`\n    has feature names that are all strings.\n\n    .. versionadded:: 1.0\n\nSee Also\n--------\nSpectralBiclustering : Partitions rows and columns under the assumption\n    that the data has an underlying checkerboard structure.\n\nReferences\n----------\n* :doi:`Dhillon, Inderjit S, 2001. Co-clustering documents and words using\n  bipartite spectral graph partitioning.\n  <10.1145/502512.502550>`\n\nExamples\n--------\n>>> from sklearn.cluster import SpectralCoclustering\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> X = np.array([[1, 1], [2, 1], [1, 0],\n...
